# Basic Setup
## General Requirements
Followings are minimum requirements for SDK:
- iOS 8.0 and higher
- Internet connection

Supported architectures in SDK:
- armv7 and arm64 for devices

## SDK Installation Guide
1. Copy “ShuftiPro.framework” into your project folder.
2.  In xcode select your project -> your project under TARGETS -> General -> Embeded Binaries
3.  Add “ShuftiPro.framework” in Embeded Binaries.

## Permissions:
Application Info.plist must contain an **Privacy - Camera Usage Description** key with a explanation to end-user about how the app uses this data.

## Verifications:
Shufti Pro supports two modes of verification:<br />
**1. Identity Verification**<br />
**2. Card Present Verification**

## Integration: 
See the sample project provided to learn the most common use. Make sure to build on real device.
```sh
import ShuftiPro
```
Make an instance 
```sh
let instance = Shuftipro(clientId: "your-clientId",
                               secretKey: "your-secretKey",
                               parentVC: your viewController from where you want to open ShuftiPro)
```
## Card Present Verification
For **Card Present** verification
```sh
instance.creditCardVerification(country: "your country",
                                      cardFirst6Digits: "your cardFirst6Digits",
                                      cardLast4Digits: "your cardLast4Digits",
                                      phoneNumber: "phoneNumber") { 
    (result: Any) in
    print(result) // Callback response for verification verified/declined
    let reponse = result as! NSDictionary
    if reponse.value(forKey: "status_code") as! String == "SP1" {
        // Verified: Do something
    }else{
        // Declined: Do something
    }
}
```


#### Request Parameters 

| Parameter | Description |

| country | Full Country name or ISO2 Code . Example: United Kingdom or GB. |
| phoneNumber | Customer’s phone number with country code. Example: +440000000000 |

## Identity Verification
For **Identity** verification using ID documents (Methods: "**driving_license**" or "**passport**" or "**id_card**")
```sh
instance.documentVerification(method: "type of method for verification",
                            firstName: "your first name",
                            lastName: "your last name",

                            phoneNumber: "your phone number") { 
    (result: Any) in
    print(result) // Callback response for verification verified/declined
    let reponse = result as! NSDictionary
    if reponse.value(forKey: "status_code") as! String == "SP1" {
        // Verified: Do something
    }else{
        // Declined: Do something
    }
}
```

> **Note:** Run project on real device.

#### Request Parameters 

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| method | Which type of verification would you like for your   customers? <br> Possible   values: <br> <ul><li> passport </li><li> driving_license </li><li> id_card</li></ul> |
| firstName | Customer’s First Name. The maximum length of the string is 32 characters and minimum required length is 2 characters. |
| lastName | Customer’s Last Name. The maximum length of the string is 32 characters and minimum required length is 2 characters. |
| dob | Customer’s date of birth (YYYY-MM-DD). Example: 1980-01-31 |
| country | Full Country name or ISO2 Code. Example: United Kingdom or GB. |
| phoneNumber | Customer’s phone number with country code. Example: +440000000000 |

## Customize Colors
You can customize SDK colors by using their **Hex Color Codes**
```sh
instance.topBarColor = "#C62B2A" // Color for top bars except camera view
instance.topBarTextColor = "#FFFFFF" // Color for text in top bars except camera view
instance.bottomBarColor = "#C62B2A" // Color for bottom bar except camera view
instance.bottomBarTextColor = "#FFFFFF" // Color for text in bottom bars
instance.progressBarColor = "#01A95B" // Color for Progress bar
instance.activityIndicatorColor = "#C62B2A" // color for activity indicator
```

## Asyncronous Feedback
If async value is set to true then you'll instantly get the user's control back so you don't have to wait for the verification results. When a request is verified you'll automatically get a callback and you can also check the verification status by making a separate [RESTful API call](https://github.com/shuftipro/integration-guide#get-request-status). 

```sh
instance.async = "true"
```

## Response Status Codes 
| Status Code | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| SP0 | Not Verified |
| SP1 | Verified |
| SP2 | Success! -- Contains the redirect url in message parameter |
| SP11 | Length Validation -- [parameter_name] maximum and minimum length limit is [parameter_name] characters. |
| SP14 | Duplicate reference -- If a duplicate reference is provided. |
| SP15 | Invalid client id -- Client id is invalid or not found. |
| SP16 | Missing required parameter -- ["parameter_name"] is required but either missing or empty |
| SP17 | Invalid format -- ["parameter_name"] is not in the correct format. |
| SP18 | Invalid signature -- Invalid request signature. |
| SP19 | Invalid country code -- Invalid country code or country is not supported. |
| SP20 | Invalid Phone No -- Invalid phone number is provided. |
| SP21 | Invalid Method Name -- Given verification method is not supported. |
| SP23 | Invalid DOB -- Date of birth is not valid. |
| SP24 | Blocked Client -- Your account is not active. |
| SP25 | Request Timeout -- Send in callback when request timeout |
| SP26 | User has been landed on verification page |
| SP27 | Request is already processed |

## Sample project setup
In ViewController.swift add your **Client ID** on line 14 and **Secret Key** on line 15, thats it!
> **Note:** Run project on real device.
